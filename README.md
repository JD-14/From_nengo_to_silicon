# From_nengo_to_silicon (Optimization of Silicon Neuron Network)

Implement a digit recognition system using a Neural Network(NN). 
Using nengo as the starting point, the objective is to adapt a LIF NN from nengo to a silicon version. 
This process involves creating the NN in Nengo-Core, then python, and finally Ngspice. 
Currently the accuracy for the the NN is as follows: Nengo_core = 71%, Simple_Python_Version = 18%, Silocon_Neuron = 9%. 
The objective is to improve the accuracy of the silicon NN as close as possible to the results obtained from Nengo-Core.
